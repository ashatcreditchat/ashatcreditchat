ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ash

Iâ€™m interested in machine learning and data engineering projects. 

I'm mostly self taught and primarily a data guy, but I've been at this a while. I have lots of experience in business and building all kinds of systems. 
 
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects. I'm very interested in finance and property markets right now. If you're doing something in that space and you need help I would love to connect! 

I'm currently working on a few projects in the retail lending space in Australia - if you're curious get in touch.
