ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ash

Iâ€™m interested in machine learning and data engineering projects, and software dev generally. 

I'm mostly self taught and primarily a data guy, but I've been at this a while. I was a programmer > turned banker > turned back to programmer. I've got lots of experience in business and building systems. 
 
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects. I'm very interested in finance and property markets right now. If you're doing something in that space and you need help I would love to connect! 

I'm currently working on a few projects in the retail lending space in Australia - if you're curious get in touch.
